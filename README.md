# x-css
A personally crafted, expressive, css library for use in personal projects and competitions with a focus on attractive visual effects and simple animations. 

x-css is designed to be *simple* and *expressive* and is characterized by:

### 1. Simplicity
**x-css** embraces simplicity by offering a concise set of classes with just a handful of variations. This approach minimizes the need for extensive configuration within the class attribute, preventing you from essentially writing out extensive CSS rules inside of your html.

### 2. Descriptive Class Naming
Unlike many other CSS libraries, **x-css** takes a more descriptive approach to class naming. The class names are intentionally less abbreviated, ensuring that they convey a clear and qualitative description of the effect they impart on your HTML elements.

### 3. A Small Utlities Library
To fulfill its commitment to concise yet descriptive class attributes, x-css provides a streamlined utility library compared to other frameworks. This approach encourages developers to associate attributes like paddings and font sizes with tag types or easily understandable custom classes/IDs. This not only ensures consistency in design but also keeps the class attributes short and manageable.

x-css asks developers not to shy away from writing CSS but rather to use it as a valued companion. By complementing your own CSS with x-css, you can craft visually appealing websites without comprimising readability.
